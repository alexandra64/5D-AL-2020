      <p>This street art, depicting a boy who has apparently just spray-painted "I Love Boston" on the wall next to him, is located on Gainsborough Street at Northeastern University. The style and black-and-white coloring greatly resembles the work of the well-known artist Banksy. Banksy, whose true identity is unknown, has painted graffiti-style works on structures throughout the world - could this be one of them? It turns out that this piece, according to the university, is the work of French artist Jef Aerosol. Like Banksy, Aerosol makes use of stencils and spray paint to create his work. Aerosol's subjects include celebrities as well as everyday people.</p>
